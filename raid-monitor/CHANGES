CHANGES for "raid-monitor for Xymon"

v0.9.8 (2014-06-13):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- raid.d/megaraid.raid: add `-nolog` option and exclude temperature on newer
  controllers

	- the `-nolog`-option was missing which resulted in growing logfiles to
	  be written. If you were using the `megaraid.raid`-module please check
	  for the files `Mega*.log` and `Cmd*.log` on your system (depending on
	  your setup these may be writte on `/`)

	- newer LSI controllers and firmware versions include temperature
	  values, these are properly excluded from the output now


v0.9.7 (2011-04-17):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- added "summary of test result" as the first line of the status. This needs
  tail(1) and sed(1).
- replaced all calls of external programs to use variables
- added basic testing for availablity of external programs


v0.9.6 (2011-03-27):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- raid-module for LSI Megaraid controllers added (raid.d/megaraid.raid)


v0.9.5 (2010-10-02):
